The prefered method is below:
> Faculty Member Sponsors a User
> 
> A faculty member with an already approved project on one of Princeton's clusters can sponsor additional users on that cluster by sending a request to cses@princeton.edu. Requests must come directly from the faculty member and not from members their research group. If the new account should have access to certain group directories (e.g., /projects) or other resources then please state that in the request.
> 
> We can only provide accounts for individuals with a Princeton NetID. Any non-Princeton user must be sponsored by a Princeton faculty or staff member for a Research Computer User (RCU) account.
