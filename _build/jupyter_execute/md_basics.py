# Molecular dynamics basics
# =========================
# 
# Static DFT or other ab-initio (Quantum chemistry) calculations provide us a lot of useful and very accurate information. However, atoms and molecules around us are in constant motion at finite temperatures.
#  Molecular dynamics(MD) simulation techniques model this motion. The driving force behind the motion could be ab-intio calculations or empirical potentials. Several
#  flavors of MD have been developed among ab-initio and classical techniques to tackle different type of processes. Empirical potentials can be further classified into reactive and 
# non-reactive potentials. Recently, an additional flavor of machine learning (ML) based potentials is also being developed.  Different molecular dynamics techniques have different 
# levels of accuracy and uses.
